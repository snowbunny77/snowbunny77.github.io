            <h2>Disclaimer!</h2>
                <p>A lot of this information could be incorrect, as history is often rewritten to fit an agenda. And the truth of the matter is,
                    one such agenda in the past was to erase any notion that any respected figures could have possibly been queer. Read ahead at
                    your own risk and corroborate this information with your own research.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>LGBTQIA+ people have existed all over history. Being queer is intertwined with being human, and for as long as we've been here,
                    so have the queers.</p>
                <p>However, in many cultures, queer people have been shamed for being heterosexual. The stories of queer people have been blotted
                    out so as to not stain the respected figures we know with the label of queer that some take as negative.
                </p>
                <p>Being queer used to be something to hide, lest one be subjected to ridicule, scandal, and shame. It's just now that we're able 
                    to step out of the shadows, learn to read between the lines, and learn about our hidden history.
                </p>
                <p>This is only the beginning of our history. We've just began the fight and we've already made good headway in making the world
                    more accepting of us.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you learn something new from this, and I highly encourage you to do your own research on this topic.</p>
